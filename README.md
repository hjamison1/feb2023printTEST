2.9.2023.14:25.  I didn't think i could learn the basics of C# and write this Technical Screening Coding Exercise in 72 hours.  The majority of my time is spent learning from scratch.  I am familiar with writing programing for AV control Systems and building touch screen interfaces with command code behind it, but that was years ago and i definately didn't do it on short notice.  Thank you for your consideration.  I feel like once i learn C#, i can potentially write this code in a few hours. Lets see if i can get something working by the 72 hour deadline.
